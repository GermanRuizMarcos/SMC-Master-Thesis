# Abstract

The aim of this thesis is to investigate and identify a relationship between
musical ability and creative musical thinking in free-improvisation by means of a
digital instrument. So that, a set of learning metrics have been designed where the
technical skills are computed as the product of the spatial, frequential and cinematic
analysis of each performance, weighting the final value according to its error, and
the creative skills are computed as the product of the variables novelty, surprise and
value. This last parameter is calculated according to the coherence, fluency and
error correction of the segment being studied.
In order to evaluate the learning metrics, two experiments were designed and
carried out. The first one, which was score-based and executed by the author,
helped in proving the orthogonality between the variables through a statistical χ
2
test, as well as evidenced the optimal translation of the gestural data into low-level
descriptors and its progress to high-level descriptors through the metrics. The second
experiment was carried out by a group of ten people, five musicians and five nonmusicians.
An affirmative correlation between the Technical Skills and the Creativity
variables was determined by means of the statistical Spearman Coefficient.
In addition, some tendencies were shown in the experimental results, as the
preference of participants to explore effects on frequencies rather than long distance
scans. Likewise, a clear learning curve was revealed in what respect to the technical
skills for both groups, as well as in the error correction analysis demonstrated by
the non-musicians.
To sum up, some contributions and improvements are included in the last chapter.
One of those is the necessity of improving the fluency calculations, where the
window shifting seems to need some recalibration.
So that, this document arises from the seek of a quantitative relationship between
the musical ability acquisition and the creative musical materials, succeeding
in finding an affirmative and detailed answer to the research question, an proving
the potential of the proposed metrics.
